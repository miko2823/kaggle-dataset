# kaggle-dataset

Thanks for kaggle's dataset, I'm studying about data science.
These files are mostly Classifier or Regression with datasets for beginner.
Though there're a lot of models I need to examine, I only use models which I understand their methods and structures.

Keep studying about math and statistic, I'll add more complicated datas and upgrade olders.
